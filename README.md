### **Overview of the Task:**

The task involves creating a Java program to perform basic file handling operations such as reading from, writing to, and modifying text files. This task is part of an internship assignment, and upon successful completion, a certificate will be issued to the intern. 

The goal is to develop a script demonstrating various file operations with clear documentation. The operations include:
- Writing text to a file
- Reading content from a file
- Modifying a file by appending new content

### **Key Objectives of the Task:**

1. **Write to a File:**
   - The program needs to handle writing text to a specified file.
   - If the file does not already exist, it will be created.
   - If the file exists, it will overwrite the existing content with the new text.

2. **Read from a File:**
   - The program should read the content of the file and display it to the user.
   - It must handle reading text files, including multi-line content.

3. **Modify a File:**
   - The program should modify an existing file by appending new content to it, rather than overwriting the existing data.
   - After modifying the file, the updated content should be displayed.

### **Technologies & Concepts Used:**
- **Java I/O (Input/Output) classes:** The program makes use of classes like `FileWriter`, `Files.readAllLines`, and `Files.write` to perform file operations.
- **Exception Handling:** Basic error handling is implemented using `try-catch` blocks to ensure that the program can handle issues like file access errors, file not found, or read/write issues.

### **Program Flow:**
1. **Initial Write:** The program begins by writing some initial text to a file (if it doesn’t already exist).
2. **Reading the File:** It then reads and displays the content of the file.
3. **Modifying the File:** The program appends new content to the file and saves it.
4. **Final Read:** Finally, the updated file content is read and displayed to verify that the modification was successful.

### **Expected Outcome:**
- **Text Written:** The program should successfully write the provided text to the file.
- **Content Displayed:** The file’s contents should be printed before and after modification, confirming the correct file handling operations.
- **Modification:** The new text should be appended correctly, demonstrating that the program is capable of modifying the file without overwriting its existing content.

### **Documentation:**
- **Clear Instructions:** The program includes detailed comments explaining each function’s purpose and steps.
- **Error Handling:** The program includes basic error handling mechanisms to ensure smooth file operations, even in case of potential issues like missing files or permissions errors.
  
### **Deliverables:**
- A fully working Java program demonstrating file operations (write, read, modify).
- Proper documentation explaining how the file operations work.
- A script that can be executed on any compatible system to demonstrate file handling in Java.

This program meets the requirements of demonstrating fundamental file handling capabilities in Java and can be considered a useful utility script for basic text file operations.
